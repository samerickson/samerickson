# 👋 Hi there!

I am Sam Erickson, I am currently finishing my last semester of my BSc in Computer Science at Vancouver Island University. I enjoy algorithms and dynamic programing, scripting in lua, and authentication/cybersecurity. 

**🔭 I’m currently working on**

- A bachelor thesis on how playing regular Minecraft can be used to teach topics in computer science to children
- A REST API that handles worksummaries and client information for trades based companies
- Endlessly tinkering with my Neovim configuration to improve the speed of my development workflow

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

- JWT Authentication
- Golang
- Docker
- **L**anguage **S**erver **P**rotocol (LSP) for improved code linting and autocompletion
